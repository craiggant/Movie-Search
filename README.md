Built using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), this application fetches movie data from an external API and presents it to users. When a user clicks on a movie card, a second call to the API to retrieve additional information about the movie. This information is then presented to the user in a modal.

This application also:
